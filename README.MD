**Description:** Add your favorite musician to the Musician Database.

Enter artist name, date of birth, birthplace, genre and if deceased add date died. If musician is still alive
leave the died date at its default value of mm/dd/yyyy.


The server calculates musicians age based on dates fields. The geographic coordinates
for the artist birthplace are calculated on the server using the Google Geocoding API. 


**CSS Positioning:** Grid

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
Created a single-page app that contains the form and the results.
I had difficulty thinking of how to best format my data to send to the server. I sent
a json string and read the first key in the converted JSON and routed my the requests based off this key.
I'd like to improve this. I'd also like to add the ability to
modify data. I added the ability to delete data based on entry index.
