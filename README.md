## Your Web Application Title
https://a2-theryancirella.glitch.me/

My project is a virtual grocery list that takes in from the user the name of an item, its price and the quantity of the item they would like to purchase. Then, it computes the total price the user will pay for the items.
To use this app, enter in a product name and then enter the price of the product in the form of X.XX without the dollar sign. Then enter in a quantity as a whole number.
In the CSS, I used a large header and then used a table beneath that to hold all the list data. I used the Grandstander Light 300 text from Google Fonts and incorporated it in the CSS.
The table is stretched to 80% of the screen and the input fields are right under them. The buttons are below everything. The CSS centers everything to make it look modern.
