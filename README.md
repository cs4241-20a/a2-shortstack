## a2-mattheusnascimento
My project is a simple application that takes someone's name and birth year and adds it to a list alongside their calculated age. for my CSS formatting I used a flexbox in my project. The table will not display until at least one input is received. input is accepted once the submit button is pressed. empty inputs or non-numerical inputs for the birth year may cause undefined behavior of the table.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I implemented a table of values that is displayed alongside the input form and is updated every time new input is received.
