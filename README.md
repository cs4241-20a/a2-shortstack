This project is Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js. The intention of this project is to deploy a prototype webpae using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.

## La Fleur by Pooja Patel
I created a flower shop webpae that woud allow a user to shop for single flowers or a dozen. The Webpage also allows the user to see their order history and also edit or delete their order.
The CSS positionng techniques that I used were using element selectors, ID selectors, and class selectors. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Order Form**: I included a form on the landing page for the user to order flowers.
- **Form completon checking**: The form will be checked if has been completly filled out. if the form has not, an error pop-up will appear. Otherwise a submission page will appear.
- **Menu on webpage**: For easier navigation the webpage includes a menu to switch between ordering flowers and looking at the order history.
- **User History Updates**: The webpage will update the order history table when the user selects the history page, the user will be able to update or delter the order. 
- **Price Calculation**: A function was included to calculate the cost for the ordered flowers.
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Transition background for color scheme**:  Using JavaScript and CSS I was able to use a color scheme to modulate between a  few colors to animate the background.
- **Images that match theme**: I included imaes on my webpage to add to  my projects theme and color scheme.
- **Various form options**: The form I created included text-box repsonses, radio buttons, and a submt button.
