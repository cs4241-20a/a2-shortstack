## Raymond's Initiative Tracker
My application is a simple initiative tracker for Dungeons and Dragons or a similar tabletop roleplaying game. In those games players and enemies take turns, so keeping track of the turn order is helpful. 

I used flex for my title and grid for position of the rest of the elements.

The derived field is optional. You can either enter the initiative that a player rolled when the 'roll?' box is not checked, or you can roll it in the application. If 'roll' is checked, the form asks for the initiative bonus, which is a positive or negative number. Ex. Jill Holyhand the monk may be quick and have a +4 to initiative, while Grognas Flatfoot may have a -2. When entering in this way the app takes your bonus, rolls a d20, and adds your bonus to get your initiative number.

Additionally, the arrows on the end of creatures are used to resolve ties. If two creatures have the same initiative, then the up and down arrows can be used to position them correctly (in game the tie can be resolved a number of ways, either saying the creature with the higher initiative bonus goes first, the player goes first, or through rock paper scissors).

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that provides a form for users to submit creatures and updates the display with the new data whenever a change is made. 

- **Technical Achievement 2**: This app allows the user to create, remove, and (lightly) edit data. creatures are added using the form. The user can delete any player from the initiative order if there is a mistake or the monster is defeated. The player can update the order to resolve initiative ties using the up and down arrows.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Classmate test
    - Name: Hunter Trautz
    - What problems did the user have with your design?
        - He commented that it was unclear when things were highlighted and I should add hover effects.
    - What comments did they make that surprised you?
        - I was surprised that Hunter understood the interface so well from first glance and he thought it looked clean.
    - What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
        - I would add more colors and hover effects to make the interface more easy to understand.
