## Game High Scores 
This form allows a user to submit their initials, a score in a certain game, and their location, and the server will determine their rank among players who have also submitted scores and display this info in a table on the page. It uses a flex box to format the position of items on the page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page App**: The table on the main page always shows the dataset that is currently being stored on the server. When a user submits new data, that data is processed by the server and the table is updated with the changes to the server side data.
