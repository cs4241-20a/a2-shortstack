## HANDY-DANDY RUNNING TRACKER
This is a simple web app to track your runs. The app also calculates approximately how many calories 
you've lost (calculations are pretty imprecise).

For CSS, I used FlexBox, CSS Grid and Table to display the results

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I've made it such that the Client side 
                          always displays up-to-date information from the server. 
                          The way a typical request happens is I send data to back-end, back-end processes it, 
                          calculates derived data, updates database and responds with the derived data and then I update the client accordingly.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
