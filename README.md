## Project Manager
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
A Web App for managing projects. The user is able to upload their projects with its name, description, start date, and end date. The Web App assigns a priority number based on the distance between the start date and end date so the user can decide how to complete their assignments.
I used flexboxes in this application.

To use the application:
A User must submit data via the text boxes on screen.
All Dates are in MM-DD-YYYY format
The reset button resets the table on screen and the server to the starting state.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of get and post requests, the user is able to view the data on the server everytime a new entry is submitted. Thus, the data that is on screen is always the information on the server. 
Everytime a new entry is added, the priority column is updated for that individual row.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 

Interface testing:

Eric Reardon
1. He menioned how the date entry is a bit skewed. You are able to enter dates that are greater than 12 months or 31 days.
2. The problem mentioned above was something I thought I fixed, so I was very surprised to see it.
3. I would definitely add clearer guidelines and how to enter dates within the design. Maybe by having a tool tip or paragraph underneath that explains the format.

Rory Sully
1. He mentioned how unclear the reset button could be to some users in terms of what it does. It is not clear whether or not it resets a row, the entire table, on the server or on the client or both.
2. I was surprised that both Rory and Eric did not mention anything about how the colors were on my website. It was pretty basic and I could have done a lot more to make it look better design wise.
3. I would try to add more colors to my web page to make it look less bland and add instructions above or below the reset button to describe exactly what it does.
