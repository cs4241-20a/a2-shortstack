This project created a two-tier web application which is a registration form. This form takes in the user's name, date of birth and gender and creates a fourth field for age by using a constant value of 9/16/20 to come up with the person's age in years. The font used is Lucida Sans Unicode. I used CSS selector elements for id, class and elements.
