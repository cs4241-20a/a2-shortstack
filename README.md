## Rapper Name Generator
Author: Jenna Galli

Given a first name and a favorite color through user input, this website will generate the user's rapper name.

- To store the user's data, communication between the client and the server was heavily relied on. 
- A problem that was encounted a lot during this project was making sure the references to elements in my HTML and CSS files were correct. 
- In the future, a database can be added to this application to store the data more securely. Also a more in-depth alogorithm could be used to generate the rapper name.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data (first name and favorite color) and always shows the current state of the server-side data once the user submits the form.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I got feedback from 2 students


1.
- Freglette

    - When she entered her information, she used a color I had never tested before. With that color the correct rapper name was not generated because there was a bug in my code.

    - When she commented on this bug, I realized where my error was. Without her testing that one case, I wouldn't have known about the issue. 

    - She liked the color and the layout. I wouldn't change anything about the interface from her feedback.
2.
- Simoneau

    - He pointed out that my textbox input said to type a 'username' instead of a 'name'. I forgot to change this default text when I was working on my project, so him pointing it out helped a lot.

    - Since I had been staring at the code for a long time, I overlooked small details that he saw right away. His comments were very helpful. 

    - He suggested to change my submit button text from `Calculate` to `Generate` and I agreed with his suggestion. Therefore in the final product I have changed this.
