## Course Registration Website.
For this assignment I created a basic form that allows a student to enter their major and register for a course.
I used css to implement a color palette and styling making the site user-friendly. Aditionally I used a basic Javascript server to store info input by the user in a database.  

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implemented PouchDb to store a local copy of the data entered by the users
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Maintain an auto incrementing id in the server to link the data in the database and the frontend

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in `style.css`, I added a div to encapsulate the form and adjust it position relative to the window sizing
- **Design Achievement 2**: Tested the application with 2 users finding that round edges were better recieved as well as a consistent font throughout the site. Changes Implemented after consulting.
