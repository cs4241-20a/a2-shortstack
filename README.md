For this assignment, I have created an online multiplayer 
number guessing game. To begin, enter a username and your 
guess. The server will respond and tell you whether your
guess was higher or lower than its number. The fewer guesses 
it takes to figure out the number, the higher your position 
on the scoreboard! I hope to encourage users to "metagame" by
looking at each others answers. However, don't wait too long
as winning users will have their last guess obstructed from view!

I used flexbox to position my elements. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: My application displays the current
 state of server data (user info) 
 at all times. Additionally, I have added an easy-access 
 button to refresh all tables.

- **Tech Achievement 1**: My application supports adding, updating,
and deleting of guesses. 
    - Adding is accomplished by clicking the submit
    button after entering username and guess data. 
    - Updating is accomplished by clicking the submit button with
    an existing username and new guess
    - Deleting is accomplished by clicking the delete button with an
    existing username in its respective field
