## MMO DPS Tracker
For this project, I created a simple application that allows MMORPG gamers to track how much damage they do in raids and boss fights. This is tracked using Damage Per Secong (DPS).
I used flexboxes for the page columns, the table, and the input form. To use the app, just fill out a fight's name, total damage, and time (in minutes and seconds) and click "submit!" The table on the right column will keep track of all your entries, with some extra statistics above it.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using Javascript, I was able to keep both the input form and the results on the same HTML page. With each entry, the table and text labels on the right column update, keeping track of previous entries.
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my application with two other students from the class. Here are the results:
  - **Test 1**
    1. Nina Taurich
    2. Nina was confused that she could enter more than 60 seconds in the "seconds" input box. She was also concerned that the user could forget the input boxes' purpose once they entered in text and removed the text box hint.
    3. I was surprised that she could figure out how to use the application just from the minimal text hints I had in, but it was a pleasant surprise.
    4. Based on Nina's feedback, I would add in text labels next to the input fields to indicate their purpose. I would also add code to ensure that the maximum number of seconds a user could enter would be 59.
