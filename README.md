## Watchlist

https://a2-chaarke.glitch.me/

My application is a place where you can easily create and modify a movie watchlist. You enter a movie title and a priority rating based on how interested you are. The server returns a sorted list of all the movies you have added to your list. To modify a movie's priority, simply reenter the title with the new rating. If you only want to see your list, without adding anything, you can leave the title and rating fields blank and hit submit. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Single page website -- updates the user's List in without leaving page. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: If the "movie" and "rating" fields are left blank, data is not added.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Rudimentary password system.
- **Tech Achievement 4**: If a user tries to add a duplicate name (incorrect password for existing id), they get a random number appended to the end of their name and a fresh list.
