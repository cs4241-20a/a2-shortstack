# Alex's Training Log

## Description

[https://a2-afsimoneau.glitch.me/](https://a2-afsimoneau.glitch.me/)

I created this project to be a running log for my daily training. I centered all of the major CSS elements in a grid layout and margin centering. It calculates a relative fitness score using the distance traveled and the time taken to approximate the training effect of a run. The form checks if you submit empty data and raises alerts to avoid blank fields in the application data

## Technical Achievements

- **Single-page App**: Using POST requests, data is updated from the server on initial page load and on submission.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Student Client Tests**:
  - *Alexa Freglette*

    - ***(feedback)*** Expand outward instead of squishing
    - ***(positive)*** Easy to use and see what's going on
    - ***(positive)*** Warns if you do it wrong
  - *Jenna Galli*
