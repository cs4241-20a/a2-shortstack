## iPrioritize
My application, iPrioritize is a simple tool that consumes a task, priority level, and creation date and gives a general plan of action to reach the goal. I used a flex box to manage and style the main container that has the form in it. The instructions and labels are super straightforward. The server checks the JSON object in string form and is able to make a decision and update the user with that decision quickly.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: My application meets the Tech Achievement as it is one page, provides a form for the user to submit data, and offers feedback and updates with the derived field in a table as soon as the data is submitted.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
I had two individuals test my app:

Isabel Alvarado:
Problems with my design include the spacing on the table. Isabel said that she thinks the table could use more spacing.
Comments made that surprised me is that she liked how simple the design of my app is and that everything is straightforward.
I would change up the interface to be more readable and spaced out based on what Isabel told me.

Pradnya Mahurkar:
Pradnya had similar feedback than Isabel. Prior to submission, I had Pradnya test my app and she told me that the items on the page could be spaced on the page more. I cleaned up the spacing but after I asked her to test my app again, she mentioned the same critique that Isabel had, that the table could use some more styling and spacing.
Comments made that suprised me are that the design was that the app has some empty space and some places where empty space is needed.
I would change up the styling of the table more after hearing Pradnya's comments and I would maybe add some more features to fill out the empty space.
