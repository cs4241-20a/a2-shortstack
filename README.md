For this assignment I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript to create a website that collects user reviews on phones, tablets, and laptops. The user would input in their own ratings for each of the categories asked and with those ratings the website would calculate and present the overall rating in a table.

# Concepts that Application Demonstrates

## HTML
- Incorporated at least one form tag 
- Utilized tables to allow my website to display all the data that is currently on the server 
- Recieved no Error or Warning messages when validating website

## CSS
- Made use of the flexbox to help layout my website
- Added various styling rules to Element, ID, and Class selectors 
- Defined all the styling rules in the style.css file under the css directory

## JavaScript
- Added some JavaScript code to get/fetch data from the server
- Implemented the server to perform logic on the recieved data


# Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: Able to make my webpage to be only using one site that is able to provide forms for the users to submit data and also always showing the current state of the server-side data.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Implemented application to allow the users to add, modify, and delete data items residing in the server's memeory.
