## WPI themed To Do List
The user fills out the for with a task and the number of days till it is due (number of days must be a number) and then hit the submit button
if the user wishes to update the due date of a task all they have to do is use the same exact task name and it will be updated in the to do list
the to do list is sorted by priority, lower priority number means it needs to be done sooner. The priority was calculated by the server.

CSS: Grid for the form feilds

server hosts on port 3000
