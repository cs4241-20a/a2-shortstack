## Can they drink? Database
My website is a database wherein patrons will enter their information and then owners will be able to look at the data and have whether or not that person is legally able to drink be printed. I used the flexbox CSS in order to position the website, as well as Roboto and Anton fonts.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: By updating a table with the most up to date data on every submit, the full database will be shown. This table can be revealed or hidden based on clicking the show data button, though it is always updating even when hidden.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 1. Larson 2. Not much feedback when submitting, colors unnapealing, would like table to be shown on website load instead of behind button. 3. Did not think the button would have been a commenting point as I thought it would have been a wanted feature. 4. I would add tactile feedback to button press as well as update colors.
