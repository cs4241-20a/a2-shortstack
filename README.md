## Homework To-Do List
https://dev4848-a2-shortstack.glitch.me/

This is a to-do list that allows users to dynamically add and delete homeworkds from their list. The list will take in a name for the homework, what subject it's for, and the due date. Once all fields are filled out, the user will have to click the Add button and it will be put on the list. On the homework table, there is also a derived field called "Priority", which determines how far away the due date is from today's date and the closer it is the higher the priority will be. Once a user has completed the homework and want to remove it from the list, they can simply click the Finish button and it will be gone. For the layout, I used a flexbox as it was to center and space things out.
