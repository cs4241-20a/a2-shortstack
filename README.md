## Your Web Application Title

For this project I wrote a simple todo list. This is a single page application and there are no special intructions needed to run. Just type "npm start" to start the server and then open "localhost:3000"
For styling: I used the "display: flex" css feature to design an easy and nicely arranged page.
Also used features like "background-image: url()" to add a gif to a page, using "background-repeat: repeat" to keep the gif constantly playing.
Also used basic features like width, height, padding, color, background color, borders, border-radius( to round corners ), etc

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. Meaning the server responds back with the updated data and the client then updates its data display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:

- **Design Study**:
  Study conducted with:
  Sadie Lombari
  Charlie Kittler

  First I will outline the prompt given to my peer to complete. Ideally this should only take around 3 minutes to complete.

  1. Create a todo list with 5 tasks
  2. Use the interface to interact with the tasks (ie if a task is done, check it off)
     Then (through Zoom) I asked my peers:
     What problems did the user have with your design?

  Feedback:

  1. Sadie said : "The interface is plain and could use more colors. Also the checkbox's do not line up with the right side of the container"
  1. Charlie said: "Maybe add more functionality. The gif added a lot of flow and a simplicity to the page that looked appealing"

  Suprising Comments:

  1. A comment that suprised me was that Sadie said it was plain. My goal was to make the page have a simplistic feel to it. I tried to make the gif the main attraction of the page.
  2. Charlie did not give me any suprising comments, the expected feedback was a lackluster functionality and thats exactly what he pointed out.

  Possible Changes:

  1. Based on Sadie's response, maybe I should add some more vibrant colors to the page.
  2. Based on Charlie's repsonse, if I had more time I would've implemented a way to delete todos when the checkbox was clicked on.
