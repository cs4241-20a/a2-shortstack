## Hipster Forum

Matthew Kaminski [http://a2-matkam7.glitch.me](http://a2-matkam7.glitch.me)

This project is an experimental forum design (think reddit), but where there is only one 'post' and the most recent comment chain will be on the top (like an rtc). A type of person who would use this website would be a game developer and their community. In this version, creating comments, modifying them, and removing them is implemented, but future updates will include a reply system and an 'upvote' system and filtering.

Flexbox was used to handle resizing the window cleanly. Try resizing the windows and see the different elements stack cleanly. Also, all CSS selector types from the requirements were utilized, and a Google Fonts font was applied.

Using this application is self-explanatory. You simply fill in the forms and hit submit to do the requested action.

The derived fields were the creation time and number of words in each post.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: (10 points) Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. Whenever an action is performed on the client, the server sends back the updated HTML and the client updates accordingly in real time. This works for commenting, modifying, and deleting posts.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: (10 points) From Teams: "For a 10 point technical achievement, you can implement the ability to change the database in all three ways." You are able to update the database all three ways.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: (5 points?) I'm not sure if this counts as a design achievement, but I spent a very long time messing with colors and fonts to make the website look appealing. This website was used for the color selection (highly recommended) [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/)
