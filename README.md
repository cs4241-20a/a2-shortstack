## A Suggestion On Your Future Gameplay
Use margin-left on almost everything, and center-align for text; all css selectors are implemented. To run the project, need to type npm install mime and npm install pouchdb. Also make sure you have "enabled npm" when the project doesn't run.
Enter four values; they will be stored and then displayed. Cost per hour is calculted based on inputs.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Successfully implement the database with add function; derived field will be last column in result part: cost/hour. Update the display each time new data is entered into form and then added to memory.
The suggestion differs only when the cost/h is less than 1.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Gong: Game Cost and Hours Played catagory may have input liminations on only float; and it's confusing because when she entered info for the second time, catagory name disappeared. Her comment on input limitation surprised me because I didn't think of it before. I may try to change it so it will reappear for new turns of inputs.
Liu: The one sentence suggestion that appeared after inputs is intereting, but in every turn users need to delete those category names, which is annoying. His comment didn
t really surprise me, but I will start thinking about changing input type limitation again.
