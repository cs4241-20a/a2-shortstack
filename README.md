===

This assignment aims to introduce you to the concepts and practice involved in creating a prototype (i.e. not deployment ready) two-tiered web application. The baseline aims of this assignment involve creating an application that demonstrates the use of several specific pieces of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js functionality.

## Roster Builder
https://glitch.com/~kirstenhart-a2-kirstenhart

This is a web app to build a roster. The user can add, modify, and delete players from the roster depending on what button is selected. To use this app, information about the player is entered into the 5 fields and the player is added if the "Add Player" button is selected, the player's stats are modified if the "Edit Player" button is selected, and the last entered player is deleted from the roster if the "Delete Previous Player" button is selected.

CSS is used in this project to format and style the page with element, ID, and class selectors.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The app is a single page and updates can be made to the data.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The ability to add, edit, and delete data from the server.
    - There are some problems when editing player stats. The goals and assists are concatenated instead of summed. I was unable to fix this problem before the deadline.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: N/A
