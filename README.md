## Tyler's Task Prioritization Calculator

https://a2-tylersprowl.glitch.me/

This webpage allows you to add tasks to a database, along with their difficulty on a scale of 1 to 9 and how many days until their deadline. The derived field returns a value of "Sooner" or "Later" depending on how urgent it believes the task to be. I used a CSS grid, and all should be self explanatory.
