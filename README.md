My project is a simple reading list that takes in a book title and # of pages from a form that the user fills, converts the data into a JSON, creates
an new variable 'hours' that is the estimated time to read the book based off of the number of pages, and returns the data to the client
to be displayd on a table. I also used two different Google fonts(Goudy Bookletter 1911 and Kumbh Sans) for all of the text within the program.
My CSS uses both id selection and element selectors. I also used flex on the container for both the form and the table so that they would be able to
appear side-by-side.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: My application is a single page app that updates the data on the client side in real time. The data that the user inputs
  is sent to the server and that data, along with the newly created variable is sent back to the client and added onto the table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:

1. Gilmore
2. Gilmore was able to easily add books to the list and see the data come up on her screen, and did not run into any issues
3. Gilmore noted how she really liked the simple design of the page. She thought that the simple design fit the page well,
   and that the picture header tied everything in. Gilmore also thought that the color scheme fit well.
4. Gilmore thought that there could be more space between the form and the bottom of the picture. She thought the form being placed
   in the middle of the screen to better take up some of the space.

- **Design Achievement 2**:

1. Buyck
2. Buyck was also easily able to add books to the list
3. Buyck noted that she liked how the color scheme and fonts resembles that of a book, and the table border detail.
4. Buyck thought that the inputs could be larger so that they are more easily seen when opening the page.
