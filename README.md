## Lab time/space slot booking
Due to COVID-19, many labs now requires appointment or sign-in before physically going to the lab. Inspired by that, I made a simple webpage that allows people to make appointment to the space (for experiment, for normal use or both in the lab) and time (date, from/to time) with essential personal information. 

## Requirements
- **Implementation**: All baseline requirements were completed. The form would require user to enter 7 fields, and the table would record 8 fields, with 1 derived field. After submission, the table on the right side of the page would update with your submission. "Modify" amd "Delete" buttons are included for people to change their decisions. Derived field ("Time slot (min)" in the table) was also calculated, which represents the total time he/she scheduled for lab in minute.
- **Demonstration**: Form tag is used to present the submission form on the right side of the webpage, with checkbox, radio, textfield, date and time as input. Table tag is used to show the result within the memory. This page is validated using the link provided. CSS styling 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: A single-page app is created. Once the information is submitted on the left side of the webpage, the table on the right side would update with all data stored inside server. The data shown below is intentionally left inside the storage as a reference. ![Date](Capture.PNG)
- **Tech Achievements 2**: The functionality of adding, modifying or deleting data items residing in server's memory is achieved. Adding is completed with the 'submit' button; modifying and deleting can be achieved by the buttons shown beside each table entry.
