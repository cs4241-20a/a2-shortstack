Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===
## Rec Center Work Schedule for Chris
This is a page that keeps track of shifts in WPI recreational center. The page uses the CSS grid layout using the table tags. I attempted to make the app be able to add, delete, and update. In the process, I have used flex-box, flex-direction, and other tools I have used. For this project, I decided to use only flex-direction. I used flex-direction so in future when I have to add more cells, it will be more organized and easier. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: This app is a single-page app that provides entries for users to submit data and always show the current state of the server on the same page on the side. If entries are put in, it will calculate the time worked and the pay for that day. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1) Last Name: Yang
2) Problems: No problems encountered.
3) Surprising Comment: Change the color palette and probably add the ability to delete and update in future.
4) Potential Solutions: Change the color palette using photoshop. For delete and update, I have tried it with "real_index.html" file, but had difficulties using eventHandler. Maybe a good idea to go to office hours.

1) Last Name: Gold
2) Problems: No particular problem encountered.
3) Surprising Comment: Wants error messages to pop up better. Add the ability to delete and update in future. Also the size of the image is a bit too big.
