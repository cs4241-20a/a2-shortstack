## Order Placing and Fulfilling Platform
https://a2-ikyriazis.glitch.me/
This website allows users to place orders. Only one type of product is available but comes in different colors and sizes. The user also enters the quantity of the product
they desire. The administrator can then remove orders from the database once they fulfill the orders. I used a flexbox to align the elements of the webpage.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I use a table to display all the data stored in the server. It is updated every time an order is placed or fulfilled. The derived field is the order number.
This field is derived from the previous order number.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I use the Kumbh Sans font from Google Fonts.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I use two colors I've obtained from the Adobe color wheel.
- **Evaluation Achievement 1**: I ran a user study on my girlfriend. I told her to fulfill order number 13 when there were 15 orders in the database. She had no trouble with it.
- **Evaluation Achievement 2**: I ran a user study on my 9-year-old brother. I told him to place an order for "5 green mediums". At first he thought he could edit the table directly.
When that didn't work he looked at the form and saw that he could select colors and sizes. He then was about to place an order without a quantity but I reminded him that he
needs 5 of them. He then put the correct quantity and submitted the order. From this I learned that my application isn't the most intuitive to a 9-year-old.
