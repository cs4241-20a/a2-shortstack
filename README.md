## Billbo Swaggins' Car Dealership Inventory System
This is a page for a car dealership to keep tabs on what car they have in stock - allowing the user to add some basic car details to a list. The page format was achieved by using a CSS grid layout - with the list itself using a table tag. Enter the car make, model and year (between 1879 and now) and click submit to add a car to the list. The page will automatically calcuate the age of the car from the year inputted.

## Technical Achievements
- **Create Single Page App**: The program is a single page app that updates with (and stores) the data inputted by the user. When new car details are added to the list, a script updates the html page and displays the details in a new row on a table, then communicates with the server to update the data stored on it in order for it to be persistent (so long as the server is on).
