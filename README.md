## A Simple ToDo List Web Application- Assignment 2
This web application is a simple to-do list. You can add items with a priority number 1, 2, or 3. These priority numbers will tell you hve many days you should complete the task within.
I included an image in the header of the list. The header contains the title of the page and the current date. The conent of the list is listed below this header section, and displays the list when elements are added.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I printed the item, priority, and timestamp to the server.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: When a user inputs an item and priority to the list, I display that data on the page by pushing the data into an array and adding html code to the page.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I added a "removeToDo" function that allows the user to delete items from the list.
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I display how many days the user should complete their task in based on their priorty of the item
- **Tech Achievement 5**: I have a checkbox item that alllows the user to mark an item as "complete" when they have finished it.
- **Tech Achievement 6**: I clear the input text fields after that item was added to the list (the default text re-appears).

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I used an trash icon from Fontaawesome.com and used as a button to delete a listed items. I used the opacity feature of the item to change the shading of the icon when a user hovers their mouse over it.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I surrounded the submit button by a border and when a user hovers their mouse over this button, the shading of the button changes. 
- **Design Achievement 3**: I used the imported font, Indie Flower, from Google fonts.
- **Design Achievement 4**: I used seperate classes to classify different text on the application to make the application parallel.
- **Design Achievement 5**: I display the deadline date in a different color than the other text.

### Think Aloud with Student
- **Nicole Jutras was my test participant**: She said that the application was very intuitive to use and she liked the design of the application. She did not experience any difficulties using the application. She suggested that I added an icon over the whole submit button instead of having a button within a border.
She also suggested that I shade the input text boxes a darker color in order to know that it was an input text box. I think her feedback was helpful and I understand her thought process. Based on her feedback, in the future I would add more icons instead of buttons and shard teh input boxes a darker color.
