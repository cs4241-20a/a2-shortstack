This website is used to maintain a database of existing entries for any given race day. To create a new rider's entry,
you must fill out their name and bike number, and select their bike brand and the class they are racing in. The table
to the left will then be updated to maintain all current entries. Any existing entry from the table may then be edited or deleted.
If edited, the entry will be recreated / filled in on the new entry side to await a reprocess. The grid CSS position technique is
used to split the screen into left and right sections. Please use full screen when on this website.

### Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data, and also always shows
  the current state of the server-side data in realtime.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: My website allows users to complete all three actions of adding data, modifying data, and deleting data to/from the table.

- **Tech Achievement 3**: My form requires every selection to be filled out in order to process it into the table. If a field is missing,
  the form will alert the user that all fields must be complete.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my user interface with two different students in the class.

1. Henriques

2. The only problem that occured was due to her laptop screen being smaller than the monitor / laptop I created my project on, and therefore her screen displayed a scrolling bar that was unintentional.

3. No comments surprised me.

4. I could dit this site to be more space-aware when on different sized screens.

1) Tolbert

2) The only problem that occured was he originally had the website as half screen, when it needs to be made full screen.

3) No comments surprised me.

4) I could edit this site to be more space-aware in different sized windows.
