For the assignment, I created a simple todo list. I used a ul for the tasks although I totally should have just used a table, oh well. I used CSS element, class, and id selectors as well as multiple gridboxes and used the Google Lato font for all text. The due date field is determined by the priority and the current date.

This is not my best code ever, I am truly sorry for any pain it causes.

### Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I added the functionality to delete tasks using a delete button next to the task, however, I did not implement modifying tasks.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The site is a single page which has the form and live updates as you add or delete tasks.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- Did not do the Design Achievement
