## Among Us Companion
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

Among Us is a popular murder mystery game, and my project serves as a companion to it.

To begin, select the map you are playing on and add the player names, their corresponding colors, and click the "start" button. If the player names or colors are not unique, you will be prompted to make unique selections.

Clicking "start" will bring you to the game page, where you can add notes and mark players as dead. Holding down the spacebar will display the game data.



## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: When on the game page, holding spacebar will display the current data on the server. This can be tested by adding new notes under players, and then viewing the server data.

### Future Improvements
- Add functionality to the "add player" button
  - on click, a new player line should be added with a max of 10 players
- Add functionality to "dead" button
  - on click, add a red semi-transparent background to the player
- Add "confirmed crew" and "confirmed imposter" markers
- Improve stylization
  - More appealing "notes" section
  - General styling
