## ToDo List
[Link to site](https://a2-zhechengsong.glitch.me)
 
It's a simple ToDo List application in which you can add task by inputting task name, priority and start time. The system would calculate the due time based on the priority
(30 mins for high priority, 60 for medium and 120 for low)<br />

To use it:
1. Enter all required input (If you didn't fill all in, system would use default values)
2. When you finished one task, you can click the 'x' at right-most part of the task to delete it


**Important info:**<br /> There can only be 5 task shown at the same time, trying to add more task will not work.

**CSS Positioning:** Margin, Padding, Position, Text-align

**About validation:**<br /> It's saying that **<form action = "">** isn't allow, but professor said it's used so that we won't be direct to new window so I'm not sure what to do with it.
