This is a To-do list web page that allows a user to add new taks and generate respective deadlines based on the start date and priority of the task. I used flexbox for layout as it helped simplify the process of adding tasks for the website. To create a task, fill out all fields at the top: the task name, the priority level, and the start date. Click the blue rocket icon to submit this task to the task list below. To edit a task, click the green edit button on a given task, make the desired changes to the name, priority, or start date, and then click the check mark to indicate you would like to save your changes. To remove a task once it has been completed, click the red X mark next to a given task to remove it from the list.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page application that allows the user to submit tasks to their list and displays the changes as they are made. Additionally, if the user removes or edits a task, these changes are shown by updating the display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
1. **Student Evaluators**: Malik, Patel
2. **Problems**: It was difficult to tell when an item was being edited due to the edit button being static. Additionally, in the entry field it was not initially clear that you could edit it due to the dark text color. Another feature that was confusing was the rocket icon on the submit button as it is relatively small and not obvious at first glance what it does exactly.
3. **Comments That Surprised You**: I was surprised that the rocket icon was not intuitive but it makes sense that it should stand out more.
4. **What I Should Change**: I changed the edit button to display a check mark to more intuitively show when a field is being edited and that it needs to be clicked again. One feature that would have been good to change is to have the main entry box look like it can be edited by making the placeholder text color more faint.
