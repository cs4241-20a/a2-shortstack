## CS4241 Assignment 2- A To-Do List

I made a simple to-do list that allows a user to enter a task, priority level,
and due date. Then the "Add to List" button is clicked and the task with the
input elements appears on the list below. I utilized CSS grid styling to
create my application.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I made a to-do list application that is on a single page
  and moves the to-do action, the priority level, and the due date to the
  server.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: For the UX requirement, I have answered
  the four questions below.

1. Padir
2. The user thought I should have made the fields in each
   entry reset after typing in a task and submitting it, so
   that when they entered a new task they would not have to erase their
   prior one from the entry boxes.
3. I was surprised at how the user sugguested the prior comment, because
   it had simply not occured to me that I could do that.
4. I would implement the changes the user sugguested by refreshing the
   fields after every to-do list entry.
