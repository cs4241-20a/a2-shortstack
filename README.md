## Your Work Advisor
My work advisor is a To-Do List which gives the user advice based on the priority of a certain task. To create this To-Do list I used an HTML form, a JavaScript server, an HTML table, Google Fonts, and flexbox (for my font layout). The application takes your task, the due date, and the priority as input and gives an output with some advice. You can see all the tasks that you have entered in the form of a table in the 2nd half of the page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
Created a single page app that both provides a form for the users to submit data and alsways shows the current state of the server-side data. As soon as the user hits the "Create Task" button, a row of the user input + the advice is created in the table in the second half of the page.
