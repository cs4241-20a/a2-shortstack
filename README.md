## Homework To-Do List
https://dev4848-a2-shortstack.glitch.me/

This is a to-do list that allows users to dynamically add and delete homeworkds from their list. The list will take in a name for the homework, what subject it's for, and the due date. Once all fields are filled out, the user will have to click the Add button and it will be put on the list. On the homework table, there is also a derived field called "Priority", which determines how far away the due date is from today's date and the closer it is the higher the priority will be. Once a user has completed the homework and want to remove it from the list, they can simply click the Finish button and it will be gone. For the layout, I used a flexbox as it was to center and space things out.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-sided data. When the user adds or delets data, the server sends back the updated data and the client will update its data display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
1. **Student Evaluator**: Thammana
2. **Problems**: The table width kept changing when inputting values and the finished button was not clear on its purpose.
3. **Comments That Surprised You**: The rest of the website is clear, neat and cocise in its design
4. **What I Should Change**: I should make the table width a fixed value and big, so big values don't change it a lot.

1. **Student Evaluator**: Abouaf 
2. **Problems**: The input fields were not clearing once you added one homework.
3. **Comments That Surprised You**: The table should sort through the priority and the title + heading sound a little redundant
4. **What I Should Change**: Make the table go in order from High -> Medium -> Low priority and once some hits the add button, the input fields should clear up.
