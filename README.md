## List Creator
Sadie Lombardi

My web application is used to create lists. This project allows users to modify the title, as well as add and delete the list entries. List items may also be crossed out.

This project is in the data editing domain area.
The main problem this application addresses is a lack of a quick, interactive, and easy way to make a list. 
Creating list items that may be deleted and/or crossed was a key innovation. 
This addresses the problem, and is a perfect way to make a list.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Allow users to modify, add, and delete data stored on the server.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Several elements were created in javascript dynamically to support functionality on the server including an "x" button for closed items and checkmark for ticked off items.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. 
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in `style.css`, dynamic styling was introduced using the hover selector on several elements including ul, li, span, etc.
- **Design Achievement 2**: When tested with two peers, there were no design problems. Some comments they made to me which surprised me were "I would change the color scheme to have a red x out button" and "I wish the tasks that you cross off went to the bottom". I would change the location of crossed off list items of my interface based on this user feedback. Peers: Neville Ingram, Charlie Kittler. Task: Create a simple grocery list.
- **Design Achievement 3**: Used color.adobe.com to create a color pallete, see attached photos.
