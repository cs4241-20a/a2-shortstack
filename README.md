## Nike Running Club new member sign-up
This sign up webpage that provides a form for users to input their username, full name and date of birth. This information is collected by a script that sends it to a server running node.js. The server stores the data inputed in the form and derives the age of the user to then return the stored field plus the derived field for them to be displayed on the same frontend webpage. In other words this is a single-page app that always updates the shown data to be in sync with the server. I used CSS layout to organize and position all the elements. The website is User friendly and self explanatory with a welcome message.
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement**: Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.
