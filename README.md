## My TODO List
This is a simple web app made to keep track of a list of tasks that are due. The user can submit a task with a certain priority and using that with the creation date of the task it determines when the best deadline is based on that information. The ccs position technique I used is flexbox via bootstrap. This web-app also contains all the required CSS selectors, element, ID, and class. Also all the pages validate correctly with no errors or warnings.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**(10 points): I created a single-page app that provides the form to submit data and will always show the server-side data. On submit it adds to the table and refreshes the table to show everything. The server also calculates the deadline based on the priority and creation date of the added task.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used moment js for the date formatting. This allows me to add a certain amount of days to the creation date in order to properly predict the required deadline.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I decided to use bootstrap for the css portion of the web app. This allows a better look to my web app and allows better coloring and overall just better style. I included the css file via the internet. I also added a custom image that fit the color pallete of my web app.

## NOTE: You may need to run `npm install` as moment is installed as an npm package and that's how the dates are generated.
