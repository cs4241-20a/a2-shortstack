## Inside my Refrigerator
By: Alexa Freglette

This project can be used to keep track of food items and distinguish where to place them in your refrigerator. 
The derived field is placement, which is determined by how much a perosn enjoys an item as well as the size of the item. 
For styling i wanted to create a site that was playful and colors that are similar to the blues and grays of refrgerators.
I kept this in mind when picking out my colors and Google fonts. 
CSS positioning techniqes I used include padding, flex, grid, margin, and text-align. 
To use the application make sure to fill out all of the fields.
